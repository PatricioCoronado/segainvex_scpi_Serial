The library is written in C. Segainvex_scpi_Serial is a library to communicate Arduino with PC through the SCPI protocol. You can send commands, with or without parameters, from the PC to Arduino. As a result, Arduino executes a function defined in the application and can return system variables to the PC.

It can work with Serial port type Hardwareserial. 

The PC application test_segainvex_scpi_serial written with the LabWindows / CVI environment is also provided. In order to work, you must install the LabWindowsCVI runtime engine: http://www.ni.com/es-es/support/downloads/software-products/download.labwindows-cvi-runtime.html To send commands to Arduino you have to click with the right button of the mouse in the textbox in "communication" window, then the "send command" window appears.
